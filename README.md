This project was bootstrapped with [React Typescript Storybook Starter](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-storybook-starter/).

# Install

First, you'll need Git and NodeJS installed.

[Here's the git install instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

[The NodeJS instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then, clone this repository into { target-directory }:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsprow/repleotech-storybook.git { target directory }
cd { target-directory }
```

Install the NodeJS dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

# Usage

To start the dev server:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

You can also build your design system for publishing to private npm or your own github instance:

npm run build
```

You can also build your storybook for static file hosting so your designers can see it:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

Happy to take contribution/improvement suggestions.
